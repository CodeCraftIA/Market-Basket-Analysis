# Market-Basket-Analysis
This project utilizes Python and various data analysis techniques to explore and derive insights from transactional data in a grocery store context.

# Data Preprocessing and Transformation: 
Conversion of transactional data into binary format and categorization of basket values.
# Association Rule Mining: 
Implementation of the Apriori algorithm to discover frequent item sets and association rules among grocery items.
# Customer Segmentation: 
Application of K-means clustering to group customers based on their transactional behavior (basket value and recency).
# Statistical Analysis: 
Calculation of cluster statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and profiling of each cluster.
# Integration and Insights: 
Incorporation of cluster labels into transaction data for further analysis and interpretation.

This project demonstrates practical applications of machine learning and data mining techniques in retail analytics, aimed at understanding customer behavior and optimizing business strategies.
